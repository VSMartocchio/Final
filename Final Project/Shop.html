                    <li>
                        Our design team created a wonderful way of connecting similar colors provided by AriZona to create a product that resembles one of their most famous drinks: AriZona Green Tea with Ginseng and Honey.
                        We used the same colors that are placed on the wrapping to help draw back its connection.
                    </li>
                    <li>For AriZona's 30th anniversary, we've decided to throw in a limited offer for 30% off for this limited purchase of Adidas Gren Tea. Use promo code: AriTea to receive this offer.</li>

                    <li>
                        Our design team focused more on understanding and capturing the key aspects of the shoe. There definetly are a few "pieces" of the shoe that really sets the tone for the rest.
                        Figuring out where the aspects would get placed was an interesting tackle for the desing team. The purpose of these shoes is to portray the success of Michael Jordan when he was signed with NIKE and the Chicago Bulls. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Since next year is going to be the 40th anniversary of when Michael Jordan signed with NIKE and the Chicago Bulls, we've considered uphold another offer: 40% off your limited purchase of BULLS40.
