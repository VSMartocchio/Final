                <h3>Adidas Green Tea</h3>
                <h3>Selling Price: $79.99</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <p>Partnered with Adidas&trade; and AriZona&trade;</p>
                        <p>
                            Our design team created a wonderful way of connecting similar colors provided by AriZona to create a product that resembles one of their most famous drinks: AriZona Green Tea with Ginseng and Honey.
                            We used the same colors that are placed on the wrapping to help draw back its connection.
                        </p>
                        <p>For AriZona's 30th anniversary, we've decided to throw in a limited offer for 30% off for this limited purchase of Adidas Gren Tea. Use promo code: AriTea to receive this offer. Offer ends 11:59pm on December 31, 2023.</p>
                        <p>All sizes in stock</p>

                <h3>BULLS 40</h3>
                <h3>Selling Price: $119.99</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <p>Partnered with NIKE&trade; and the Chicago Bulls&trade;</p>
                        <p>
                            Our design team focused more on understanding and capturing the key aspects of the shoe. We emphasized what was needed, for example, Michael Jordan's player number as well as the trophies on the back of the shoes.
                            Figuring out where the aspects would get placed was an interesting tackle for the desing team. The purpose of these shoes is to portray the success of Michael Jordan when he was signed with NIKE and the Chicago Bulls. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Since next year is going to be the 40th anniversary of when Michael Jordan signed with NIKE and the Chicago Bulls, we've considered to uphold another offer: 40% off your limited purchase of BULLS40. 
                            Use promo code: ChiBulls to receive this offer. Offer ends 11:59pm on October 26, 2024.</p>
